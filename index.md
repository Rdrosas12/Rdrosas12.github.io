## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

* Lab 6, Part-2
This was my favorite lab because it was so much fun. Blank Jack is one of my favorite card games to play with friends, so being able to create a program that understands all the rules and recognizes the value of each card was truly amazing. Running the program and watching it follow the steps while producing the correct output was fascinating and enjoyable to see.

* Lab 9, Part-1
This was my second favorite lab because we created a spell checker program. This program could identify misspelled words and show those that were spelled correctly. It was very satisfying to code a spell checker, as being able to develop a tool that could identify and correct mistakes within the dictionary file.

* Lab 4, Part-2
This was my third favorite lab because we got to create a fun code where we have to guess a secret number of the other player. It was fun to learn how to play the game and figure out how to create a code that lets us play there.
